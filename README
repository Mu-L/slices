== About ==

The Slices package provides implementations of slice-based datatypes for all of
Go's basic types, as well as two separate implementations for handling slices in
the context of reflection values.

Currently there's no documentation but the extensive test suite includes
numerous examples of how to use slices to solve common tasks.

The package has its origins in research for the GoLightly virtual machine
project but has since taken on a life of its own.

I hope you will find it useful.

The next release version will leverage Generics as introduced in Go 1.18. This
will be a breaking change for older versions of Go.
